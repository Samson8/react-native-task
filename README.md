Absolutely! Here's a clean and professional `README.md` draft for your Pokémon React Native task project:

# 📱 Pokémon Explorer

This is a simple **React Native app** that interacts with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch and display a list of Pokémon. Users can view detailed information about each Pokémon, including images, types, abilities, stats, and more.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Fetch and display a paginated list of Pokémon
- 📄 View detailed information about each Pokémon
- 🖼️ Display official artwork, sprites, and stats
- ❤️ Toggle favorites (feature ready for extension with Context API)
- 🚀 Smooth navigation between screens
- 📱 Responsive UI designed for mobile devices

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React Native** with TypeScript
- **React Navigation** (native stack)
- **PokeAPI** for Pokémon data
- **Context API** (setup ready for state like favorites)
- **Toast Messages** for error handling
- **FlashList** and performance-optimized components
